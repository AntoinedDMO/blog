                    <p>The Met Office Informatics Lab combines scientists, software engineers, and designers to create new things. We try to rapidly prototype non-business-as-usual ideas that allow people from within the Met Office (and beyond) to make our science and data useful.</p>

                    <p>The core group works as part of the UK's Met Office, which is one of the world's leading operational weather forecasters and climate change research institutes. However, we are really keen to work with anyone who has an interest and wants to collaborate on any of our projects.</p>
