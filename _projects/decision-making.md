## Project Description
People don't care about the weather. Not on the whole. Usually they want to make a decision about something personal to them. Members of the public might really want to know "Should I take my umbrella when I leave for work?" or "Am I better off going for a hike or going to the cinema on Saturday?". At the other end of the spectrum, people in private industry might want to use the winter seasonal forecast to ask "What price should I sell my energy futures based?" or "How many woolly jumpers do I need to manufacture this winter?".

The Lab's mission is to find new ways of making Met Office data useful. With this project, we want to let people combine their data with ours in a ways that are functional and unobtrusive.
