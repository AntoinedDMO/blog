Scientists - Join Us!
=====================

If you've got scientific expertise then we'd be really keen to work with you.

Firstly, the primary aim of the Lab is to give people access to information (as opposed to data), and scientists are the experts in getting information from data. We want you to help us minimise the amount of work we need to do with technology by using innovative scientific solutions where possible. We think this is best the way to get the most from our data.

Secondly, we need people who really understand the information in order to make sure we are communicating it properly. You can help us make sure we are getting the right message across. We also need you to help us decide which information might be the most useful to people.

Its also worth mentioning that if you are a scientists who can code, then don't hesitate to [get involved as a coder](/get-involved/coder) as well if you like.
