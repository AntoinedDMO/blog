Users - join us!
================

Everything we are doing in the Lab is being done with the end user in mind. There's no point in making flashy applications that no one enjoys using, and there's no point making them complicated if simple is easier to use!

We really need your feedback to design things that are engaging and fun to use. On this page you'll find our prototypes: some of these are in very raw form - they're experiments, rather than the finished product. As such, don't use them for actually forecasting/displaying the weather...not just yet, anyway.

v0.1 Basic 2D weather map
-------------------------
[This prototype](http://msaunby.github.io/uk-weather-3d/view3d/#/?COVERAGE=UKPPBEST_Medium_cloud_cover&ELEVATION=1500-4500m&model=UKPPBEST) pulls in the latest cloud cover data from the weather forecast. The data takes a while to load so give it a chance to get going.

We'd really like some feedback on the interface for this one. Is it obvious how to navigate using the mouse? We are planning on sprucing up the controls on the left hand side of the screen, but are there other improvements we might not have thought of yet?

You can give your feedback via the [contact links](/get-involved/) or via the project [Github](https://github.com/msaunby/uk-weather-3d) page.
