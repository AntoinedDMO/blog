## Science in the browser with WebGL <small>- Rachel Prudden</small>

This session was aimed at anyone interested in learning about [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/). While we did make some reference to our own projects, the focus was really on getting people to understand the general concepts and start playing with WebGL shaders.

WebGL is used to create efficient and customisable 3D graphics inside the web browser. There are excellent libraries available to make this process easier, with [threejs](http://www.threejs.org) being a notable example. However, there may be times when you need to dive a little deeper. Writing your own shaders gives you far more flexibility to decide the appearance of your objects.

After describing how we used WebGL for our own project, giving the appearance of volumetric clouds by using ray marching, we broke off to let people start working. The group was split around 50/50 between people working on coding exercises and others who discussed how they might use the technology.

We also had demos from Michael and Jacob, showing Mike's new [WebGL globe](https://github.com/msaunby/globe-view) and our Google Cardboard [example](http://met-office-lab.github.io/ipad-fly/).

# Things we learned

> Not only were the sessions well structured and informative at Mozfest 2015, but the general vibe and enthusiasm from other creatives left me feeling hugely inspired. I also learnt the basics of how the Fly Through Weather application was built â€“ which is always a plus for someone working on the design. The staff were great too! Help was on hand whenever needed and with a constant supply of instant coffee, my lust for caffeine was always met. Roll on Mozfest 2016!
