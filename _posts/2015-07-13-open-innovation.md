Sharing ideas, collaboration and openness are at the root of how we work.

## Why Open Innovation?
Open Innovation is an approach to innovation which strives to maximize the benefits of new ideas by encouraging sharing of those ideas, typically when they might otherwise be shelved or abandoned. Open Innovation also recognizes that new ideas often emerge in other areas, maybe another department or even in another business on a different continent.  
Open Innovation is a quite separate concept from Open-source Software, or Open Data; however as Informatics Lab projects make use of, and contribute to both Open-source software and Open Data our innovation model embraces these.

### The Open Innovation model

### More than a process, is about people
And most just 'people' in a HR or 'matrix management' sense as 'resources', but
real people with skills, beliefs, and needs.

### Open from the outset
If youâ€™re running a government software project and you plan to make it open source eventually, then just make it open source from the beginning. Waiting will only create more work.

### Collaboration
The Met Office already has many formal and informal collaborations with other weather services, government departments, international organizations, university departments, commercial businesses and individuals. Some of these relationships are handled by business managers or even specialist teams, depending on the nature of the work.
