Going live!
===========	

Just a really quick post to say that we now [have a demo](https://met-office-lab.github.io/volume-rendering/viewer.html) of the work we've been doing with volume rendering that you can access online!

This is using some synthetic data, its not to scale and its a bit clunky but its a start! To be clear - this is far from finished in its current state. It has controls like a flight sim/first person game i.e. mouse looks and the arrows/WSAD move the camera.
